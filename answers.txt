1.  HTTP Response Code 200 - OK. This just tells the request was successful, and client's request fulfilled.
    HTTP Response Code 404 - Not Found - The requested resource was not found on the server
2.  Response messages provide additional information about status or outcome of the request triggered by a client.
    The differnce between the 2 is that the first one returns a 200 which means request was successful, while the second returns a 404 which implies the request sent was unsuccessful.
3.  Content length refers to size of content sent by a server in HTTP. -1 means that the length is unspecified. In the first url the length was very long hence the -1. In the second url, the content length was 1576 due to the length being determined.
4.  HTTP and CoAP use different status codes. HTTP status codes include 200, 404 and 500 while coAP include 2.05, 4.04 and 5.03.
5.  HTTP has a larger payload. This is because it supports a wide range of media types and data formats. CoAP is lightweight protocol designed for constrained devices and low-powere networks, more so the ones found in IoT.
